## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 19 with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (loaded via CDN) with custom CSS animations
- **Component Pattern**: Functional components with React Hooks throughout
- **State Management**: React useState/useEffect with localStorage for persistence and Firebase for real-time sync
- **Rendering**: Client-side rendering with conditional component mounting based on user role (STUDENT vs ADMIN)

### Role-Based Design
- **Students**: Access learning content, take tests, earn credits, participate in gamification (spin wheel), view leaderboards
- **Admins**: Full dashboard access for user management, content management, subscription/code generation, system settings, analytics

### Content Structure
- Hierarchical: Board → Class → Stream → Subject → Chapter → Content (Videos/PDFs/MCQs)
- Content types include free and premium tiers with credit-based unlocking
- Sequential chapter unlock system requiring 100 MCQs solved per chapter

### Authentication Flow
- Firebase Authentication (anonymous sign-in supported)
- Custom user management stored in both Firestore and Realtime Database
- Role-based access control (STUDENT, ADMIN roles)
- Password recovery via admin-approved requests

### Data Persistence Strategy
- Firebase Realtime Database: Content data, system settings, redeem codes
